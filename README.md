DATA EXPLORATORY PROJECT

Welcome to my deep dive into the global story of COVID-19 through data! Using SQL, I explored the twists and turns of the pandemic, tracking cases, deaths, and vaccinations across continents and countries.

Project Highlights:
Through SQL queries, I analyzed COVID's global reach, identifying countries with the highest infection rates relative to population and calculating the odds of mortality for specific regions like Canada.
Using CTEs, temp tables, and views, I tracked vaccination progress across continents, highlighting where populations saw the greatest vaccine coverage.

Key Insights:
This project was a fascinating dive into SQL's power in data analysis. I gained critical insights on structuring complex queries, using CTEs for dynamic calculations, and learned just how much data reveals about global health challenges and responses.
Whether you're here to explore SQL or learn about COVID trends, I hope you find this project as enlightening as I did!

HOUSING DATA CLEANING

This project was all about turning cluttered housing data into clear insights. Here’s how it went:
Data Standardization: Transformed complex property and owner addresses into individual columns (Address, City, State) using SUBSTRING_INDEX and LOCATE functions. This breakdown was crucial for easier sorting, filtering, and analysis.

Filling in Missing Data: Applied COALESCE to auto-fill null PropertyAddress values from matching ParcelID records. This step saved time and made data usable without manual entries.

Improving Readability:Converted SoldAsVacant values from ‘Y/N’ to ‘Yes/No’ to enhance clarity.
Removing Duplicates:Created a Common Table Expression (CTE) to identify and remove duplicate entries based on property details and sale records.

Project Takeaway: This project taught me how powerful SQL can be in transforming data chaos into clarity. Dive in to see the magic!
